# AI Chatbot Behavioral Analysis

This project analyzes the behavioral patterns of AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT, compared to human players in economic game theory settings.  
It was developed as part of academic research and contributed to a paper submission at AIBS 2024.

## Objective
- Investigate how different AI models behave in classic behavioral economics games.
- Compare AI strategies to human decision-making patterns.
- Quantify behavioral similarities and differences through statistical analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.10+
- pandas (data manipulation and analysis)
- NumPy (numerical computing)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn (visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for exploratory analysis)

## Key Files and Directories
